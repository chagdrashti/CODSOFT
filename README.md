# TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION

I notice here that accuracy score is close to 80% which makes our model a good model to predict the values accurately , here in Titanic data set our model accurately predicts as to who will survive and who will not survive.

Through Visualization we found out that females have more chances of survival than males, class 1 have more changes of survival, youth age group 20-35 yrs male from class 3 have not survived.
